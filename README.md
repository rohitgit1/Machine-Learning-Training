## Final Project
Project Problem Statement

### Customer Churn Prediction:
A Bank wants to take care of customer retention for its product: savings accounts. The bank wants you to identify customers likely to churn balances below the minimum balance. You have the customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank.
Your task as a data scientist would be to predict the propensity to churn for each customer.
